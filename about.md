# RandomGamemodeEverywhere
Randomize gamemodes everywhere!

Based on level gimmicks pioneered by GD Quasar and popularized by KUAAA and the Globed mod.

## ***THIS MOD IS CURRENTLY IN __BETA__. There __CAN AND WILL BE__ bugs at the moment, especially with __the level's ground heights being broken on the first attempt.__*** *For best results, please do __NOT__ disable the  `Don't Randomize Initial Gamemode`  setting enabled.*</c>
